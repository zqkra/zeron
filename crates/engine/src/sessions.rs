//! SessionsEngine — per-chat agent runs: dispatch, steering, interrupts, input bridging,
//! journal + broadcast fan-out, and 120ms coalesced doc streaming.
//!
//! Pragmatic port of zeron's `sessions.ts` (spec: feature-inventory §3.2):
//! - every `AgentEvent` is (a) appended to the on-disk run journal, (b) broadcast to
//!   in-process subscribers, (c) folded via `fold_event_into_parts` and diffed into the
//!   chat's `SessionDoc` through `SegmentWriter` on a coalesced `STREAM_COMMIT_MS` timer;
//! - the user message entry is pushed to the doc immediately on dispatch (id = the
//!   command's client-minted message id, so optimistic echoes never flicker);
//! - a `Steered` event splits the assistant entry at the exact boundary;
//! - recovery (interrupt or a stale journal at boot) stamps the streaming entry `aborted`.
//!
//! Scope notes: sessions are keyed by chat id (one live run per chat). Zeron's pulse
//! loop is ported as the 15s liveness heartbeat in `drive_run`; its stall watchdog is
//! deliberately NOT ported (rejected in review — agents may legitimately wait on
//! something for far longer than any timeout, and a live child IS the working signal).
//! Every dying path must instead carry its own visible error (child crash with stderr,
//! spawn failure, stream error, engine-restart recovery).
