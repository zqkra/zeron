//! DocHost — per-chat `SessionDoc` handles: snapshot persistence (debounced), edge room
//! sync (offline-tolerant), and the HOST-ONLY durable command executor.
//!
//! Pragmatic port of zeron's `session-docs.ts` + the `main.ts` executor (spec:
//! feature-inventory §3.3, ARCHITECTURE §2 "command plane"):
//! - the doc IS the outbox: commands and user entries commit locally and sync whenever a
//!   room connection exists; the engine is fully functional with sync disabled;
//! - on every doc change (local commit or remote import) the handle re-emits the joined
//!   transcript to watchers, drains pending commands, and schedules a snapshot save;
//! - command drain: evaluate via `evaluate_command` (with the DocsStore processed
//!   ledger), mark processed BEFORE execute, execute through the sessions engine, then
//!   write the outcome status back into the doc as the sole outcome writer.
//!
//! Chat ownership is gated on the workspace doc (`chats[chat_id].deviceId`), with
//! claim-on-first-command for unknown chats. Queueing a command for a chat hosted on
//! another device POSTs a durable nudge to that device's room (§7 cold-chat delivery);
//! the host's relay receives it and warm-opens the doc, which drains the queue.
