//! WorkspaceHost — owns the per-user workspace **registry** (docs/
//! registry-sync.md; replaces the Loro workspace doc after the 2026-07/08
//! wedge incidents): local snapshot persistence, edge room sync
//! (`/registry/{orgId}/ws` → room `reg1/{orgId}/{userId}`, offline-tolerant —
//! spaces/sessions are private to their owner, never org-visible), the device
//! registry row for THIS device, and the typed watch channels the
//! WatchChats/WatchDevices/WatchSessions/WatchSidebarPreferences RPC streams
//! are fed from.
//!
//! Writer discipline (kept from the doc schema): this host writes its own device row,
//! its own session-status rows, and rows for chats it hosts; renames/archives are LWW
//! sets accepted from any device (the Mutate surface).
//!
//! Liveness: `lastSeenAt` is a row write on boot/shutdown ONLY — the periodic 15s
//! heartbeat rides the room's presence frames (memory-only on the DO), so staying
//! online never grows server state.
//!
//! Migration: first boot after the update finds no `registry1` snapshot, reads
//! the legacy `workspace2` Loro snapshot, and seeds the registry from it as
//! pending upserts (historical HLCs — live writes always win). The overlay
//! serves the full sidebar before any server contact; the old `ws4` rooms are
//! simply never joined again. The legacy snapshot is kept for rollback.
