//! CheckoutDiffSync — checkout-scoped working-tree diff production (feature-inventory
//! §3.5; port of zeron's `checkout-diff-sync.ts` + `git-metadata-sync.ts`).
//!
//! Chats do not own working-tree state: a concrete Git checkout does. This service
//! groups this device's chats by their canonical checkout identity (`chat.cwd` →
//! [`Repos::checkout_identity`]), computes one bounded atomic snapshot per checkout,
//! and publishes it three ways:
//!
//! - the local `WatchCheckoutDiffs` stream (a watch channel of every checkout's
//!   latest [`CheckoutDiff`]);
//! - a [`DiffSidecar`] JSON `POST {edge}/diff/{chatId}` for every syncing chat of
//!   the checkout (bearer = engine edge token), so "review pending changes while
//!   the host sleeps" works;
//! Checkout snapshots remain live checkout state. Conversation branch identity
//! is captured by the command host and is never rewritten from this watcher;
//! otherwise one checkout change would relabel every chat sharing that folder.
//!
//! Fast recursive `notify` watchers (debounced [`WATCH_DEBOUNCE`]) are backed by a
//! slow 2-minute repair tick because native watchers may coalesce or drop events.
//! Snapshots carry a sha256 checksum; an unchanged checksum publishes nothing.
//!
//! Reconcile is deliberately damped, because it runs on *every* workspace chat
//! row change — including the `checkoutId` writes reconcile itself makes.
//! Checkout identities are memoized per cwd (chat-watch reconciles spawn
//! no git; the repair tick revalidates), and an entry whose chats vanish is torn
//! down only after [`REPAIR_INTERVAL`] of continuous absence rather than on the
//! first pass that misses it. See [`resolve_identity`] for the incident this
//! guards against.
//!
//! Beyond the working-tree watch, the service also answers one-shot
//! `GetCheckoutDiff` captures for the Changes pane's scopes: *branch changes*
//! (vs `merge-base(baseRef, HEAD)`, same capture path with the base overridden)
//! and *latest turn* (vs a temp-index `write-tree` snapshot taken when a turn
//! dispatches — see [`CheckoutDiffSync::note_turn_start`]).

/// showing the pre-commit diff for up to two minutes (user report — the
