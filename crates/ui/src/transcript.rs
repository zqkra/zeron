//! The conversation view: virtualized transcript with block-granularity rows,
//! stick-to-bottom, tool-group folding, and streaming markdown.
//!
//! Row model (docs/research/mugen-pretext.md §3):
//! - one row per BLOCK: user message = one bubble row; assistant messages split
//!   into one row per markdown top-level block, plus consecutive-tool groups
//!   (agent/spawn chips split out so they never collapse) and input/error chips;
//! - stable row ids `{msgId}#{partId}.{blockIx}` / `{msgId}#g{groupIx}` — LIVE
//!   (streaming) entries split per block exactly like completed ones (the list
//!   virtualizes them, so a fading live reply re-renders only its visible tail
//!   each frame — flat cost in the reply length); on completion each block row
//!   keeps its id, so row identity is continuous and nothing flickers;
//! - rows are cached per entry keyed by a content fingerprint — only changed
//!   messages rebuild (the anti-"streaming stutter" trick);
//! - row-set changes diff by (id, version) into one minimal `splice`.
//!
//! Stick-to-bottom is a velocity spring (mugen §1e, the same shape as
//! stackblitz's use-stick-to-bottom): while pinned, a per-frame stepper glides
//! the viewport toward the list end with a feed-forward term tracking the
//! smoothed target growth, so 120ms doc commits read as a continuous glide
//! instead of per-commit snaps. The pin breaks only on user input (the list's
//! scroll handler fires exclusively from its wheel/touch path) and re-engages
//! inside the 70px band; the first send in an empty chat anchors the prompt at
//! the viewport top and hands off to the same glide when the reply overflows.
//! Wheel/touch releases that anchor immediately, including when background
//! streaming has advanced beyond the last measured frame.
